# Changes Made to Fix Telegram Bot Black Screen Issue

## Summary of Issues Found
1. **Web Worker Compatibility**: The original code used Web Workers for background calculations, which can have compatibility issues in Telegram's WebView environment.
2. **Error Handling**: The application lacked proper error handling for Telegram WebApp initialization.
3. **Loading State Management**: The application didn't properly manage loading states, causing the app to get stuck on the loading screen.
4. **User Feedback**: Limited feedback during loading process could make users think the app is frozen.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/Components/CalculateNums.js`
- Replaced Web Worker implementation with standard `setInterval` for better compatibility with Telegram's WebView
- Added null checks for the user object to prevent errors
- Improved dependency array in useEffect hooks to handle undefined values
- Enhanced error handling throughout the component

### 2. `src/App.js`

## How These Changes Fix the Issue
1. **Telegram Compatibility**: By replacing Web Workers with standard `setInterval`, we avoid potential compatibility issues with Telegram's WebView environment.
